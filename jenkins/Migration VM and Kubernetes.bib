Migration VM and Kubernetes 

High-level approach (two parallel tracks)

Server → Cloud (VMs, storage, networking) — focus on infrastructure & operations. See the 7-R migration options (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Retire, Retain, Repurchase, Relocate). 
AWS Documentation

App → Kubernetes — focus on application modernization: inventory, containerize, package (Helm/manifests), storage & config, CI/CD, run on a managed K8s or self-managed cluster.

Part A — Migrating on-prem servers to cloud (practical steps)
1) Plan & assess

Make an inventory: OS, apps, CPU/ram, disk, network, dependencies, storage I/O, licensing, backup retention, compliance.

Decide migration strategy per workload (7-R). Lift-and-shift (rehost) is fastest; refactor/replatform gives long-term benefits but costs more. 
AWS Documentation

2) Choose a cloud and migration tools

Major providers & tools:

AWS: AWS Application Migration Service (MGN), Migration Hub.

Azure: Azure Migrate.

GCP: Migrate for Compute Engine / Migration Center.

Third-party: VMware HCX, Carbonite/Zerto, CloudEndure (etc.).
Choose based on current stack (e.g., VMware on-prem → VMware HCX or AWS MGN).

3) Network & security mapping

Design VPC/subnet structure, VPN/Direct Connect or ExpressRoute, or hybrid connectivity.

Map firewall rules, load balancers, NAT, public IP allocation, security groups, IAM/roles, KMS/key management and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA as applicable).

4) Data migration

For large datasets use direct transfer/offline appliances or accelerated network transfer services offered by cloud provider. Decide sync/winback approach (rsync, db replication, DB-level migration tools).

Freeze windows or cutover plan: plan a final sync and cutover with rollback steps.

5) Migrate VMs

Use provider migration tools to replicate and cutover VMs (agentless or agent-based depending on tool). Test boot, validate apps, and run performance tests.

6) Runbooks & validation

Smoke tests, monitoring baseline, performance validation, and security scanning. Create runbooks for rollback and for DNS cutover.

7) Optimize & operate

Right-size instances, adopt autoscaling, leverage managed DBs / managed services where it makes sense (replatform) to reduce ops burden.

Part B — Migrating on-prem apps to Kubernetes (step-by-step)
0) Choose your Kubernetes environment

Managed: EKS / AKS / GKE — faster Day-1 and Day-2 ops.

Self-managed: kubeadm, kops, or on-prem distributions (Rancher, OpenShift) if you need on-prem. Managed is usually faster for cloud migrations.

1) Assess applications & dependencies

For each app: monolith vs microservice, language/runtime, external DBs, stateful vs stateless, file storage needs, third-party services, config & secrets, affinity/tolerations, sidecars (logging/monitoring).

Draw a dependency map — this determines whether you can containerize a single service or must migrate several together.

2) Containerize (one app at a time)

Create a Dockerfile and run locally. Keep images minimal, multi-stage builds for compiled languages, non-root user, healthchecks. Example (Node.js):

# example Dockerfile (Node)
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "server.js"]


Build and push to a registry (ECR/GCR/ACR/Docker Hub):
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
docker tag myapp:1.0 <registry>/myapp:1.0
docker push <registry>/myapp:1.0
(These are standard steps — plenty of guides walk through provider specifics).

3) Create Kubernetes manifests / Helm chart

Start with a simple Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, and Ingress. Use Helm for templating and releases.

Example minimal deployment.yaml fragment:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: { name: myapp }
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector: { matchLabels: { app: myapp } }
  template:
    metadata: { labels: { app: myapp } }
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: <registry>/myapp:1.0
        ports: [{ containerPort: 3000 }]
        livenessProbe: { httpGet: { path: /health, port: 3000 }, initialDelaySeconds: 30 }


Use Helm to templatize values (image tags, resource requests/limits, replicas). Many teams migrate from Docker-Compose to Helm charts to get repeatable deployments.

4) Storage & stateful data

For databases, either:

Keep DBs outside Kubernetes (managed DBs in cloud) and point apps there, or

Run stateful DBs in K8s using StatefulSets + PersistentVolumes (CSI drivers), but understand operational overhead.

Use volume snapshots and data-migration tools for PVs when moving stateful workloads.

5) Secrets & config

Use Kubernetes Secrets (or an external vault — HashiCorp Vault, cloud KMS/Secret Manager) for production secrets. Store non-sensitive config in ConfigMaps.

6) CI/CD

Build pipeline: source → build image → push registry → Helm/chart update → helm upgrade --install or kubectl apply. Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or Cloud build services. Include image signing and scanning.

7) Observability & security

Logging: Fluentd/Filebeat → central log store (ELK, Datadog, Cloudwatch).

Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana.

Tracing: OpenTelemetry/Jaeger.

Container security: image scanning (Trivy), runtime security (Falco), network policies (Calico), pod security policies (or PodSecurity admission).

8) Backups & disaster recovery

Use Velero for cluster resource + PV backup/restore and migrations between clusters; for enterprise app mobility, consider Kasten (K10) / Veeam Kasten. These let you backup namespaces and restore them into other clusters/clouds.

9) Progressive rollout & cutover

Start with non-production clusters. For production, use Canary or Blue-Green deployments to reduce risk. Validate, run load tests, and then cut traffic gradually (Ingress or service mesh routing).

10) Day-2 operations

Add autoscaling (HPA/VPA), resource quotas, pod disruption budgets, cost monitoring, and regular security scans and patching.

Assessment

 Inventory servers/apps, dependencies, licenses.

 Map network and firewall rules.

 Choose cloud provider & managed K8s or self-managed.

Quick example: from Docker → Helm → K8s (commands)

Build image: docker build -t myreg/myapp:1.0 .

Push: docker push myreg/myapp:1.0

Create Helm chart skeleton: helm create myapp

Edit values.yaml to set image.repository: myreg/myapp and image.tag: 1.0

Deploy: helm upgrade --install myapp ./myapp -n production --create-namespace

Check rollout: kubectl rollout status deploy/myapp -n production

(That flow is the standard developer path when moving an app to Kubernetes.)

Common pitfalls & how to avoid them

Pushing everything at once — migrate incrementally; start with stateless services.

Ignoring networking differences — assume on-prem IPs/hostnames will change; prepare DNS & service discovery.

Underestimating stateful services — plan data migration carefully or prefer managed DBs.

No rollback plan — always have backups + automated rollback (helm rollbacks, previous image tags).

Missing observability — add logging & metrics before cutover.

If you want, next steps I can do right now

Pick one and I’ll act on it in this session (no waiting):

Create a migration assessment template you can run against your infra (spreadsheet checklist).

Draft a Dockerfile + Helm chart skeleton for one of your apps (tell me language/runtime — no need to repeat full dependency list).

Produce a cutover runbook for a single VM or service (with commands to replicate, switch DNS, and rollback).
